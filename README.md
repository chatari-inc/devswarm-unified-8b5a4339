## Repository Structure:

### Main Branch
Contains final winning implementations:
```
main/
├── CounterApp.swift    # Winner from CounterApp tournament
├── TimerApp.swift      # Winner from TimerApp tournament
└── WeatherApp.swift    # Winner from WeatherApp tournament
```

### Tournament Branches
Each tournament has its own branch with full agent history:
```
CounterApp/
├── CounterApp.swift           # Final winner's implementation
├── CounterApp_WINNER.md       # Tournament results
└── Full commit history from all agents

TimerApp/
├── TimerApp.swift             # Final winner's implementation  
├── TimerApp_WINNER.md         # Tournament results
└── Full commit history from all agents

WeatherApp/
├── WeatherApp.swift           # Final winner's implementation
├── WeatherApp_WINNER.md       # Tournament results
└── Full commit history from all agents
```

## Tournament Architecture:
- **ONE Repository:** All tournaments in a single repository
- **ONE Branch per Tournament:** Each component has its own branch with full history
- **Sequential Tournaments:** CounterApp → TimerApp → WeatherApp
- **Parallel Agents:** Within each tournament, agents generate code in parallel
- **History Preservation:** Every agent's implementation is committed and preserved
- **Winner Selection:** Best implementation merges to main branch
