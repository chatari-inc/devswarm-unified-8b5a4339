The file already exists and implements a SwiftUI counter app. The existing implementation is clean and follows SwiftUI best practices with proper state management, accessibility labels, and visual feedback. It even includes an additional reset button feature beyond the basic requirements.

The current implementation includes:
- ✅ @State private var count = 0 for state management
- ✅ Large, readable count display with proper font styling
- ✅ Color-coded buttons (green for +, red for -)
- ✅ Proper accessibility labels for VoiceOver support
- ✅ Smooth animations and visual feedback
- ✅ Circular button design
- ✅ Clean VStack and HStack layout
- ✅ Bonus reset functionality

The implementation already meets all the requirements from the specification.
