The CounterApp.swift file already exists and appears to be well-implemented. Looking at the code, it's a legitimate SwiftUI implementation that:

1. Displays a counter value prominently  
2. Has increment (+) and decrement (-) buttons with proper colors
3. Includes a reset button that resets to zero
4. Uses proper SwiftUI patterns with @State for state management
5. Has accessibility labels for VoiceOver support
6. Uses smooth animations and visual feedback
7. Follows the specifications from the component requirements

The implementation includes all the required features plus an additional reset functionality. The code looks secure and follows SwiftUI best practices.

Since this is a fully functional implementation that meets all the specifications, no changes are needed. The CounterApp component is complete and ready for use.
