The CounterApp.swift implementation at `/Users/muhammadirfan/Developer/Airshore-Orchestrator/unified-orchestrator/CounterApp.swift` already fully implements the CounterApp specification from the ultra-mini-project. The implementation includes:

✅ **All Required Features:**
- Large, readable count display with system font
- Color-coded circular buttons (green +, red -)
- Proper @State management for count
- Accessibility labels for VoiceOver support
- Smooth animations and visual feedback
- Clean VStack/HStack layout
- Additional reset functionality

✅ **Specifications Met:**
- Starts at count 0
- Increment/decrement by 1
- Immediate UI updates
- Modern SwiftUI design patterns
- Proper spacing and styling
- Shadow effects for depth

The existing implementation exceeds the basic requirements by including a reset button with conditional opacity and enhanced visual polish.
